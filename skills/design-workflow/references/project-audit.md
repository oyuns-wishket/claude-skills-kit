# Project audit

## Read order

1. Repository rules: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, nested rules
2. Current task history: impl-notes, HANDOFF, linked issue/spec
3. Product context: product brief, requirements, user flows
4. Design context: `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, design-system docs, tokens
5. Implementation: app shell, navigation, shared UI, page under change
6. Runtime evidence: representative URLs, screenshots, console/network logs

## Static inventory

Record:

- framework and version
- package manager from lockfile
- CSS system: Tailwind, CSS modules, styled components, vanilla CSS, native
- component library and icon system
- fonts and loading method
- theme/color/token definitions
- breakpoints and layout containers
- navigation model
- existing visual tests, Storybook, Playwright
- build, lint, test, dev commands

Use `rg` and project manifests. Do not infer the stack from the workspace default.

## Visual inventory

Capture at least:

- global shell/header/sidebar
- one dense screen
- one form or detail screen
- the exact target screen
- desktop viewport
- mobile viewport when responsive behavior is in scope

For a small feature, inspect the target plus two adjacent screens/components. For rebrand/refactor, inspect representative flows rather than every route.

## Runtime evidence

- browser console errors and warnings
- failed network requests
- horizontal overflow
- clipped/folded content
- keyboard order and focus visibility
- loading, empty, error, disabled, success states
- layout shifts and reduced-motion behavior

Do not confuse an existing runtime bug with a design regression. Record baseline issues before editing.

## Audit output

Use `assets/design-audit.template.md` when a durable report is useful. Classify every item:

- `observed`: directly seen in source or browser
- `detector`: produced by Impeccable
- `inferred`: likely consequence requiring confirmation

Prioritize by user impact:

- P0: task impossible, content unreadable, security/data risk
- P1: core flow materially obstructed
- P2: inconsistent hierarchy, responsive or accessibility defect
- P3: polish and optional refinement

For each finding include evidence, affected scope, recommended correction, and regression risk.
